# UX
To track of our user needs and stories. 

## Development

### Prerequisites

- install <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>
- run ```npm install```

### Run local server

```npm run server```

This will serve pages in the docs root at ```http://localhost:1338/``` so if you created a file at ```/docvs//birth-certificate/index.html``` then it will be viewable at: ```http://localhost:1338/birth-certificate/```
